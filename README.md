# Grandma, a KNN Library

This is a covertree library with some modifications to make it more suitable for real data. Currently, it only implements the [fast covertree](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/izbicki15.pdf), which is an extension of the original covertree [(pdf)](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/papers/ml/cover_tree.pdf).

See the code for documentation. Haven't yet had a chance to update this page or host the code somewhere.
