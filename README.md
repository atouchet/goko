# Grandma, a KNN Library

This is a covertree library with some modifications to make it more sutible for real data. Currently it only implements the [fast covertree](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/izbicki15.pdf).

See the code for documentation. Haven't yet had a chance to update this page or host the code somewhere.
