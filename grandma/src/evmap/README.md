# Jon Gjengset's evmap

This is a modification to Jon Gjengset's evmap to allow edits. It duplicates the data, which isn't ideal but is still damn fast and there are no locks.

This is here as I feel odd forking his library and uploading a new one on crates.io. This is mostly not my code, I just simplified Jon Gjengset's code.
